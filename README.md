## How to Run

This app uses Rails' encrypted credentials, which require a `config/master.key` to decrypt `config/credentials.yml.enc`.

- If you were given access to the project, make sure you have `config/master.key` in place.
- If you're starting fresh, you can generate a new one with:

  ```bash
  EDITOR="nano" bin/rails credentials:edit

**You will also need a TMDb API Key, it is free**  
Create an .env file with:
```.env
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
```
